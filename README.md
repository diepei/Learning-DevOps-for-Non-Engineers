## 🤔 Key Concepts {#introductory-questions}
### Git Explained
Git is like a time machine for your code. It tracks every change, lets you experiment safely, and helps teams work together without stepping on each other's toes.

### Linux Fundamentals
Think of Linux as the engine room of modern software. Learning Linux commands is like getting your driver's license in the DevOps world - it's essential for navigation.

### DevOps Culture
DevOps is a mindset that breaks down walls between developers and operations teams. It's about:
- 🤝 Collaboration
- 🔄 Continuous improvement
- 🚀 Fast, reliable delivery
- 🛠️ Automation

### Containers 101
Imagine containers as perfectly packed lunch boxes - everything your application needs is inside, and it'll taste the same no matter where you eat it.

### Microservices vs Monolith
- **Monolith**: One big application (like a Swiss Army knife)
- **Microservices**: Multiple specialized tools working together (like a toolbox)

### Kubernetes Simplified
Think of Kubernetes as an orchestra conductor, coordinating all your containers to play in perfect harmony.

### CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline is like an assembly line for software:
1. 🏗️ Build: Assemble the code
2. 🧪 Test: Check for quality
3. 📦 Package: Prepare for delivery
4. 🚀 Deploy: Send to production

### Observability
Like a car's dashboard, observability tools show you how your system is performing and alert you when something needs attention.
